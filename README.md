Homework 1 is regression problem to find the possible height given f(x,y) = T_height maping in Data_Training file.  

Homework 2 is a classification problem. Given 3000 data of 3 classes, each face contain 1000 data.  Use two approaches, generative and discriminative model. Generative model can generate more data based on our training result, while discriminative mode's approach is to map data into the possible solution.
